**Introduction**

This project delves deep into the examination of the chemical compositions found in a variety of cosmetic and skincare products. The beauty and skincare industry are booming with a very rapid pace, and because of that thousands of chemicals are used in products such as lotions, shampoos, and sunscreens. Nevertheless, it should be noted that not all these chemicals are well understood, and some of them may impose potential health and environmental risks. There is an increasing consumer awareness and demand for transparency which leads to a definite need for reliable, scientific information to help consumers make safer choices. The data collected in this study can be credited to the California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP), which offers a look into the chemical usage in the beauty industry for the past decade.

**Purpose**

The main purpose of this project is the analysis of the presence and trends of toxic chemicals in cosmetic products over time. This study aims to provide significant insights for both consumers and industry stakeholders. On top of that, the study wants to enlighten the public about the health hazards of some chemicals and provide safer options. At the end of the day, the research ultimately aims to put in the hands of the consumers the data-driven guidance for better decision-making when it comes to buying cosmetic and skincare products.

**Methods**

The analysis was carried out by making use of a combination of techniques in data visualization and programming models of machine learning. Data was collected from a public record which is accessible through data.gov. The visualization techniques including the use of line graphs, bar charts, and heatmaps were important to bring to the surface technological patterns in chemical usage and the identification of high-risk products. K-means clustering was implemented to group the products based on their chemical content to derive these groups respectively. The study additionally analyzed the correlations among the different product characteristics and chemical usage to understand the chemical patterns better.

**Conclusion**

The investigation discovered an alarming quantity of toxic chemicals present in customary cosmetic items, where products also including, moisturizing shampoos, anti-aging creams, and texturizing clays herald the significant chemical counts. A number of brands, for example, Regis Design Line and Palladio, were specified as being the more toxic brands among the others. In the dataset, the top issued chemical was titanium dioxide which is a concern in the nano form regarding safety. The substantial removal of harmful chemicals that is noted around the years of 2010-2012 had significantly slowed in the past few years. The importance of consumer awareness, studying the product labels, and brands that are committed to safer formulations is the focus of this study. These results also raise a call for the enforcement of strong regulatory policies to be in place so that cosmetic and skincare products will be safe for the long term.
